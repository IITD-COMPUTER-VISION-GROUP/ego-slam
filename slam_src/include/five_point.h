// Computes the relative pose between two cameras using 5 corresponding
// points. Algorithm is implemented based on "H. Stewénius, C. Engels, and
// D. Nistér. Recent developments on direct relative orientation". ISPRS Journal
// of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 2006. The relative pose is computed
// such that y * E * x = 0, where E = t_x * R and t_x is the cross product
// matrix of t. This implementation is proven to be more stable than the fast 5
// pt. algorithm by Nister.
//
// Params:
//   image1_points: Location of features on the image plane of image 1.
//   image2_points: Location of features on the image plane of image 2.
// Return: true if a valid solution was found.
